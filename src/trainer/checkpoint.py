"""Trainer checkpointing for crash recovery + single-wandb-run resume.

Design (see conversation with the user for the full rationale):

- **Scope**: "resumable-only" reproducibility. On resume, training continues
  from the same weights/optimizer/scheduler/RNGs, but the specific batches
  drawn after resume may differ from what a crash-free run would have seen
  (because `RandomSampler` re-draws its permutation on `iter()` — see
  `src/runner/data.py`). Loss curves match in expectation.

- **Atomic writes**: save to `checkpoint.pt.tmp`, then `os.replace`. A crash
  mid-save never leaves a corrupt file that would silently spawn a new wandb
  run on next launch.

- **Single wandb run guarantee**: the checkpoint stores `wandb_run_id`. The
  runner uses it with `resume="must"` — either resumes the exact prior run
  or hard-fails. See `src/runner/main.py`.

- **Config-drift protection**: `config_hash` is set on the initial checkpoint
  and asserted on resume. Prevents accidental cross-experiment contamination
  in the same wandb run.
